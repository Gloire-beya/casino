# casino

This project has been developed using Java language with Spring Boot framework. 
All the features are working fine. The following are the URIs to access the developed APIs :

---
* http://localhost:8080/players/balances/{id}
* http://localhost:8080/players/wagers/{wager}/{id}  
* http://localhost:8080/players/wins/{wager}/{id}
* http://localhost:8080/players/playertx/{username}
---

The promotion feature (bonus) was added and it's working correctly. 

**Note: When starting the application, it creates three different users. The resource of the last URI needs authentication before accessing it**
